# IDS-project

The goal of the solved project is the design and implementation of a relational database on the chosen topic. The project is solved in teams of two.

The project consists of four parts. All submitted SQL scripts must be intended for the database management system, Oracle 12c, and must allow repeated calls, i.e. deletion and re-creation, or even rewriting, of objects in the database and their data (it is okay if unsuccessful attempts occur during the first call of the script about the deletion of non-existent database objects).

### First Part: 4/5
### Second Part: 4/5
### Third Part: 5/5
### Fourth Part: 15/19
